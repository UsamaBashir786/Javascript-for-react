A practical guide to the JavaScript concepts you need before learning React. No fluff, just the essentials.

This repo covers the JS fundamentals that React uses constantly:

- **Modern syntax** – `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals
- **Array methods** – `map`, `filter`, `reduce` (you'll use these everywhere)
- **Objects & destructuring** – working with props and state
- **Async JavaScript** – `fetch`, promises, `async/await`
- **Thinking in React** – immutability, component mindset

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UsamaBashir786/Javascript-for-react.git
cd Javascript-for-react
```

Open any `.js` file and run it in your browser console or with Node.js. Each file is a standalone example you can experiment with.

## Why This Matters

React is just JavaScript. If you're comfortable with these concepts, learning React becomes way easier. You'll understand hooks, state management, and component logic much faster.
