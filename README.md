    A hands-on guide to the essential JavaScript concepts you need before diving into React. No fluff—just the stuff that matters.

    ## 🚀 What You'll Learn

    This repo focuses on the JavaScript features React developers use every day:

    * **Modern syntax** – `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals
    * **Array methods** – `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
    * **Objects & destructuring** – crucial for props and state
    * **Async JavaScript** – `fetch`, promises, `async/await`
    * **Thinking in React** – immutability, component mindset, and clean logic

    ## ⚡ Quick Start

    Clone the repo and start experimenting:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UsamaBashir786/Javascript-for-react.git
    cd Javascript-for-react
    ```

    Open any `.js` file and run it in your browser console or Node.js. Each file is standalone—play, tweak, and learn.

    ## 💡 Why This Matters

    React is just JavaScript. Master these concepts first, and understanding hooks, state, and component logic becomes way easier. This foundation will save you tons of headaches later.
