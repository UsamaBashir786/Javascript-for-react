JS Mindset Notes (Short)
Variables

const → mostly in React, don’t overwrite

let → when value changes

Avoid var

Functions

React components = functions

Reusable logic, must be strong

Arrow Functions

Short, concise syntax

Single param → no parentheses needed

Single expression → auto return

Arrays

.push() → add, .pop() → remove last

Keep original array immutable

map()

Transform each element → new array

Callback param = current element

React: render lists

filter()

Select elements based on condition → new array

Original array unchanged

React: conditional rendering

reduce()

Combine elements → single value

Accumulator = running total

React: totals, aggregate calculations

Overall

Strong JS basics = easier React

Functional programming mindset: map, filter, reduce

Use const & arrow functions for React-friendly code
